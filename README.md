# PacktBOTD
Serverless Notification Application for Packt's Book of the Day using AWS Resources and Python. \
NOTICE: I am still working on making this project easily deployable. This is a learning experience for me!

### Summary

Packt Book of the Day is a serverless notification application that notifies users via email of Packt's featured free eBooks, which can be found here: 
https://www.packtpub.com/free-learning/. \
The featured free eBook that Packt offers changes every 24 hours. At a high level, PacktBOTD uses AWS serverless resources to every 24 hours, identify the name of the book and then email users of the new featured book.
